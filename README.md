# Movies-ETL

The purpose of this repository is to gather data of different types, clean and sort the data so that they could all be readable with common titles and layout, then make analysis on all the data at once. The first deliverable was to read all of the data files and assign them to dataframes. The next was to transform the wikipedia dataframe and then the kaggle data. Finally the last deliverable was to create a database for the kaggle data. I ran into difficulty transforming the kaggle data and unable to create a dataframe.
